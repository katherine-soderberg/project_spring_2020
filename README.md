# Kathode's Package: 

This is a package that can read in a table of data describing resting MRI scans and filter 
by specific scanner metrics to perform automated quality control. It produces information
about which scans are high quality enough to proceed with processing. 


To explore the utilities of the package with the available data spreadsheet, examine the output in the "Demonstrating the package with example spreadsheet" section of the Jupyter Notebook.
