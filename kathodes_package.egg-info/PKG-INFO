        This file contains the project proposal of Katherine Soderberg.
        
        I plan to write a python script/package that will download data from my lab's (neuroimaging) database, run a baseline quality control to determine which scans are usable, and then initiate preprocessing of those scans. There are thousands of scans, so this would make the intial steps of analysis a lot more efficient. I want to expand on this and will obviously get more specific as I learn more about python scripting, but that is my general plan.
